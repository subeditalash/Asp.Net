Introduction
The project at hand was to build an application for Ropey DVD that could manage
the company's commercial operations utilizing the ASP.NET platform in the
integrated Visual Studio Environment. The application is to support the operations
of Ropey DVDs, specifically administration of the renting and returning of DVDs.
In every firm, technology plays a vital role. Ropey DVDs is a company that rents
out DVDs to customers. Renting, sometimes known as hiring or letting, is a
contract in which one customer provides for the temporary use of somebody else's
product, service, or property. Ropey DVDs is a physical store that rents DVDs that
includers movies, music or TV series. Ropey DVDs rents DVDs to clients under
the contract terms agreed upon in a rental agreement or contract, which might be
tacit, explicit, or written. With the introduction of the World Wide Web, internet
services such as Netflix and the ability to download virtually anything have grown
in popularity. All of these new ways to watch movies, listen to music, and
download files have significantly lowered demand for DVD rental stores.
.NET is a platform for developers that contains tools, programming languages,
and frameworks for building a variety of applications. ASP.NET and extend.NET
are framework extensions that include modules for constructing various types of
applications. With.NET, you may create new web apps and utilities using
ASP.NET, an open-source web platform. Windows, Linux, macOS, and Docker
are all supported by ASP.NET. This framework supports both C# and F# for web
requests. Razor is a C# web page design syntax for creating interactive web
pages. (Microsoft, n.d.).

1.1 Aims and Objectives
The application is to support the operations of Ropey DVDs, specifically administration of
the renting and returning of DVDs. The application described is simplified and is an
incorrect representation of normal practice and/or legal requirements. Please implement
the system as described in the specification rather than as in the real world where there
is conflict between them.
Ropey DVDs operates a chain of franchise DVD rental shops, i.e. all the
shops operate under a single name and share purchasing and advertising
but each shop is a separate business. Each shop is to be supplied with a
freestanding single PC computer system to manage the stock, loan and
return of DVDs to members. To borrow a DVD from a shop, a customer
must become a member of that shop (membership is not transferable to
other shops in the chain). 
Login User Manual
At first, the user must launch the web browser. The login page will appear. If the
user is already registered with the system, he or she must enter the right
username and password to log in. If the user is a worker, the user will be guided
to the store's home page that has been designated for staffs, and if the user is
an admin, the user will be directed to the store's home page that has been
designated for admins. 
Sign up User Manual
At first while running the system login page will load if the user is new to the
system, then user have to sign up them into the system which you can see on
the top right of the page.
Add member User Manual
To add a new member, the staff or admin must enter the Member first name, last
name, Membership category, address, date of birth and click Add member
button. When you press the add member button new member will be added to
the database.

While making this application to support the operations of Ropey DVDs,
specifically administration of the renting and returning of DVDs. The
application described is simplified and is an incorrect representation of
normal practice and/or legal requirements. Please implement the system as
described in the specification rather than as in the real world where there is
conflict between them of this process of software development has really
taught me as a person with different functionality and different aspects of
developing software using its aspects. I learned a lot about the importance
of proper functionality in an application that can really affect the whole
system and change it. Visual Studio and Dot Net technology were used as a
key component to complete the application development and implement
functionality in the system. This coursework was divided into 4 different
individuals, so we decided to have our own separate part and in the end we
decided to collaborate to create a complete system. So, I personally had to
do a lot of research on how to implement that special functionality that was
from me to bring it into the system. For that I had to do a lot of research
through the website and also through books and videos. In addition, I had to
visit my module leader to discuss various aspects such as source code and
databases and clarify how to implement them properly. I had done the some
query part and some documentation portion member of our group. In
addition, with the help of other member I have covered some reporting part
utilizing all ideas and technique to make attractive and perfect. I was able to
learn some C# programming by working alongside other team members. I
consider this coursework as one of the most fruitful coursework until now
